# Toy Signaling Input

This signaling data are a subset of the footprint-based signaling
activity estimates of transcription factors of the 786-O cell line from
the NCI60 dataset.

## Usage

``` r
data(toy_signaling_input)
```

## Format

An object of class “`data.frame`” containing the normalised enrichment
scores (NES) of 2 signaling proteins, which are named with their
respective gene Entrez ID matching the toy network.
