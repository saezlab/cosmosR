Essentially, COSMOS 3 main components: prior knowledge: goal COSMOS essentially connect various deregulation events together mechanistic hypotheses. mechanistic hypotheses basically known potential interactions molecular biology features, proteins metabolites. example interaction can activation MTOR AKT, EGFR canonical pathway. Thousands potential interaction can assembled together form large network interactions. networks thus called prior knowledge networks (PKN), summarize large amounts prior knowledge form network. context COSMOS interactions come Omnipath database, STICHdb recon3D reaction network. respect example interaction MTOR AKT, question usually asked presented given experimental context : MTOR can activate AKT general, interaction relevant experimental context? brings us second component COSMOS. data: Information deregulated transcription factors (TF), kinases/phosphophatases metabolites can extracted transcriptomic, phospho-proteomic metabolomic data respectively, using footprint analysis methods (see:https://github.com/saezlab/transcriptutorial (Especially chapter 4)). information can quite useful , characterize TFs kinases specifically deregulated cancer cells example. goal COSMOS find different deregulation events can connected together.
